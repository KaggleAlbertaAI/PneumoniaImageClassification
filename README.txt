Hi, we will try to classify pneumonia images using deep learning.

Three labels 'Normal', 'Lung Opacity' and 'No Lung Opacity / Not Normal'
are used in dataset. 
{'No Lung Opacity / Not Normal': 11500, 'Normal': 8525, 'Lung Opacity': 8964}
There is a relatively even split between the three classes, with nearly 2/3rd of the data 
comprising of no pneumonia (either completely normal or no lung opacity / not normal)
